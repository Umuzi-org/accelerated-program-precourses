# Accelerated Tracks - Pre-course work

## Introduction

The umuzi accelerated web development course is an intense 16 week bootcamp followed by 8 weeks of project experience.  Before a recruit is accepted into the course they will have to complete this pre-course on their own. The recruit will need to be familar with a few tools, languages and concepts before entering the accelerated program, and will have had to prove that they have the grit to make it through the course.

The bootcamp itself will focus on polishing and honing the skills learnt in the pre-course work in a very project based way. Education will be project based, including both group and individual projects. The projects will be designed to  demonstrate the recruits understanding of key web development concepts, and to worm the basis of a useful portfolio.

This resource aims to:
- contain links to all reference material required for the pre-course
- be accessable in the South African context: as far as possible the learner wont have to be online in order to access the material, it can be downloaded.

You'll need basic familiarity with bash scripting. You'll need access to bash somewhere so you can practice. You have a few options for getting this right. These options are below ordered from best to worst.
1. If you own a computer and you are happy to install linux then do so. Linux Mint is recommended: it is usef-friendly and lightweight https://linuxmint.com/download.php

   1. boot into linux from a flash drive (TODO)
   2. container based development environment (TODO)
   3. vagrant https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/index.html (TODO)
3. If you only have an android device
    get onto wifi so you dont waste your data
    install Termux.

MDN is nice because they explain things well and the websites are very simple. We could potentially wite a little scraper to grab all the pages we care about and just stick them in our repo. Or do something clever with git submodules because afaik all their learning sites are on github
